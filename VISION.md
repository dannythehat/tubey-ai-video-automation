## The Problem

Content creators running **real content channels** (true crime, missing persons, historical documentaries, nostalgia) spend countless hours:
- Manually editing videos
- Matching footage to narratives
- Assembling content frame by frame
- Writing scripts that match available media
- Creating YouTube metadata
- Finding transition footage and B-roll

**They can't use AI-generated images or videos** because their audiences demand authenticity.

## The Solution

**Tubey AI:** Upload your real images and footage with tags → GPT-5 creates the script, assembles the video, optionally enhances with stock footage transitions, and publishes to YouTube automatically.

### Core Workflow
1. **Upload Real Media** - Images, videos, interviews, footage
2. **Tag Everything** - Natural language descriptions
3. **Set Video Title** - What you want to create
4. **Enable Enhancements** (Optional) - Allow stock footage transitions
5. **Click Generate** - AI does everything
6. **Preview & Approve** - See what was added, remove if needed
7. **Auto-Publish** - Video goes live on YouTube
