## The Problem

Content creators running **real content channels** (true crime, missing persons, historical documentaries, nostalgia) spend countless hours:
- Manually editing videos
- Matching footage to narratives
- Assembling content frame by frame
- Writing scripts that match available media
- Creating YouTube metadata

**They can't use AI-generated images or videos** because their audiences demand authenticity.

2. **Tag Everything** - Natural language descriptions
3. **Set Video Title** - What you want to create
4. **Click Generate** - AI does everything
5. **Auto-Publish** - Video goes live on YouTube
