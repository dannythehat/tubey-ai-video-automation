## The Problem

Content creators running **real content channels** (true crime, missing persons, historical documentaries, nostalgia) spend countless hours:
- Manually editing videos
- Matching footage to narratives
- Assembling content frame by frame
- Writing scripts that match available media
- Creating YouTube metadata
- Finding transition footage and B-roll
- **Maintaining consistent style and voice across videos**

**They can't use AI-generated images or videos** because their audiences demand authenticity.
